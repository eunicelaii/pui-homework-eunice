# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1: Interactive Personal Portfolio*

![idea 1 sketch](images/ideasketch1.jpg)

Purpose: a personal portfolio for my photography/ videography/ product design work

- Fully interactive and fun to explore - make everything clickable
- Able to be read using a screenreader/ download a cv style version of the website
- Want to show my multifaceted skills in mixed media
- Emphasis on storytelling
- Designed to look like a video editor
- Questions: how can I make people want to explore the website, which in hand forces them to learn more about me?

- inspo: https://webflow.com/made-in-webflow/website/pierrelouis

### *Idea 2: Interactive “fridge” - recipe builder site*

![idea 2 sketch](images/ideasketch2.jpg)

Purpose: an interactive fridge that lets you click through ingredients, and it comes up with a list of recipes.

- Utilizes a preloaded set of recipes I pick
- The ingredients are directly clickable
- For accessibility, the ingredients can also be changed to simple text for understanding
- Questions: How would I track what recipes show up for what ingredient? How many ingredients must there be for the recipe to show up?

### *Idea 3: 5 min tracker - where does your day go?*

![idea 3 sketch](images/ideasketch3.jpg)

Purpose: an interactive 15-minute tracker that lets you input your daily activities, and visualize them into a bar graph and a “story”

- I'm passionate about productivity and learning how to maximize your day
- As you edit your day, your graph changes
- For accessibility, make a way so that inputting your activities is easier, eg. sliders
- Question: how would I make everything change live and smoothly? What visualizations will I use?
 
## Feedback Summary

Everyone in my lab thought I had very creative ideas. One of my classmates asked how I would emphasize the storytelling element of my portfolio, and I think I want to incorporate some videography work into my portfolio to "tell my story". 

My TA stated that the portfolio idea is a great way to showcase the skills we learned in usability and interaction design, and supports iterative and incremental development, making it easy for me to visualize my progress.

Next, my fridge idea is fun and useful to me, and is quite similar to a potential project of another student, which might allow us to collaborate and support each other if we both happen to choose this project. However, there may be some complications with creating pre-loaded and labeled data.

Lastly, the third idea is relatively simple and clean, and is a tool that anyone can use. Some consideration I was given is how would i interpret somewhat arbitrary data and turn it into meaningful stories. The complication comes with the variability of input.

## Feedback Digestion

I think I will go with my portfolio idea. Not only does it allow me to showcase all the skills we learned in this class, it gives me "room to grow". As it does not require as much preplanning as my other projects,  it allows me to build upon it step by step, giving me lots of space for manipulation and improvement. It will also be benefical to contain all my other projects as I'm busy looking for an internship. 

However, I'm still interested in my 15-minute tracker idea. I may try to learn how user-generated data comes into play in development with the "build my character" mini-game I want to include in my portfolio. I want the user to be able to manipulate my character to show my multifaceted interests and various skills, and I wonder if there is a way to ai generate different costumes depending on user input.

Now, my main concern is thinking of how it would visually look. I indicated that I wanted it to look like video editing software, meaning that there will be minimal scrolling and that everything is placed onto one "dashboard screen", so I'm wondering if formatting it would be too difficult. However, it does remind me how we formatted the notecards in lab activities, which is quite straightforward as long as I label my boxes properly, and use appropriate flex properties.
